# Integration with Ghost CMS v4

### This branch is not working, read below

Previously i was using ghost as a headless cms for content, which was over kill on so many levels. I switched to MDX after, but then Ghost released v4 and stupid wanted to try it (It's the same thing dummy, you are using it as a headless anyway!).

So after re-writing the integration I had some wierd bug with webpack and fs pkg, naturally I lost interest and checked out to main branch which had MDX.

I kept this branch for: 
 - Reference if someone wanna integrate ghost with next ( and ofcourse solve this mystery with fs )
 - I enter dumb mode and decide I want ghost integration again ( probably will happen )
