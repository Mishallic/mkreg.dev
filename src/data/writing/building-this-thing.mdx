No idea how I just decided to have my own personal site, guess I was bored and wanted to learn something not related to my specialty ( FYI I consider in-depth knowledge when building Front-end applications is valuable for someone who focuses on Back-end. You gotta optimize delivery for the Front-end app after all, whether it's Infrastructure based or code wise based )

I never worked on these new frameworks although I understand and know the concepts and how they work under the hood and I've watched a¬†[course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) about React like 4 years ago when everything was a class.

So I started my research about the good stuff. Basically the end result was to decide between¬†[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)¬†or¬†[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I decided to go with Next since I knew React and Next seemed to be always ahead, Used more and bigger sites were using it.

## Technologies used

- [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) mo, HAProxy is not just a "loadbalancer". Perfect combo with Cloudflare
- [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) well it's either NGINX or HAProxy or both. I keep experimenting so this list is bound to change from time to time.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) I hate this thing so creating build images is the first thing I do starting a project (lightweight layer built on top of Linux my ass)
- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) takes care of delivering 99.9% of the app for a specified period that i can set
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) well, why not?
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ü§î
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) Since we're building a minimal app and not over engineering stuff ‚òù, MDX seemed like a good choice
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) I saw the [guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1H38XrN7hi7wHSClfXPqQ) just adding class names to stuff and every thing works so I knew it would be perfect fit
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) Used as a staging server. It's perfect since you know Vercel will always output the correct result
whether it's about what's rendered, caching or performance.

## FAQ

- Yes I know I don't need any of this
- Indeed this is overkill
- No this is not a waste of time, I learn by doing and I treat this site as a playground
- No, It didn't take me a lot of time setting up those, I do these on daily basic
- No those are not dependencies, You can literally clone or fork the repository and deploy it on¬†[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- After the end result, I learned some things regarding both Front-end and Back-end. I might write something about it later

## Coding and best practices

This project is by no means represents a good example of how to build an app. Honestly, I didn't even think I would finish it but here we are. You will find 0 informative commits, not proper usage of TypeScript and maybe other stuff I didn't notice.

Why? Well because this is my way of learning things. I read about them then start by doing and see the results, then iterate and fix. 

Also, I was building it just to learn Next.js and some other stuff. However I didn't know that I would enjoy it so much eventually it will become my site.

If you wanna contribute, fix stuff, or whatever feel free to do so. The code is open source.

## Lessons learned

- Stop wasting your time for a month in a¬†[lab](https://rsms.me/inter/lab/)¬†just to get the perfect thing, nothing is perfect
- Iterate and enhance as you go, don't redo everything from scratch after the first failure
- No knowledge is irrelevant or a waste of time. As I said before this helped me a lot dealing with software on the other side of the spectrum
- Wanna do something? do it! stop thinking about the perfect execution. When was the last time you did something totally new and it was perfect on the first try?

## Acknowledgment

This site used alot of things from these resources, sometimes copy pasta of some component design or just some helpers code snippets, or simply by looking at the way things are handled. In the end the app deviated from those due to the rapid learning curve I gained while developing (ok serious talk, I don't copy paste anything I don't or won't fully understand and neither should you)

- [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/)
- [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/)
- [Devin Schulz](https://devinschulz.com/)
- [Timothy Lin](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/)
- [Jamify.org](https://www.jamify.org/)
- [Omar Alsoudani](https://mkreg.dev/)

What? ofcourse I included my self, otherwise who do you think will do all the copy pasta or even write this post??

## Infrastructure

I won't be discussing the infrastructure in this post due to a large amount of information, I might split that into a series of articles, however, the tools mentioned above are running on 6$ VPS. If you wanna learn more about it, feel free to contact me.

## What's next

I will keep iterating and enhancing the app, code-wise, **UI/UX** (yeah right...), tooling and content.

If you have some suggestions then contact me!
