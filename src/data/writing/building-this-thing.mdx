No idea how I just decided to have my own personal site, guess I was bored & wanted to learn something not related to my specialty ( FYI I consider in-depth knowledge when building Front-end applications is valuable for someone who focuses on Back-end. You gotta optimize delivery for the Front-end app after all, whether it's Infrastructure based or code wise based )

In this post, I give you a high-level overview of building & developing my personal site & some of the struggles for someone whose specialty is not Front-end. And by that I mean I have zero knowledge of CSS (Well not zero maybe 5%), Never worked on these new frameworks although I understand & know the concepts & how they work under the hood & I've watched a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

about React like 4 years ago when everything was a class.

So I started my research about the good stuff. Basically the result ended to decide between [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I quickly decided to go with Next since I knew React & Next seemed to be always ahead, Used more & bigger sites were using it.

The end results of technologies:

## Technologies

- [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)
- [NGINX](https://nginx.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## FAQ

- Yes I know I don't need any of this
- Indeed this is overkill
- No this is not a waste of time, I learn by doing & I treat this site as a playground
- No, It didn't take me a lot of time setting up those, I do these on daily basic
- No those are not dependencies, You can literally clone or fork the repository & deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- After the end result, I learned an insane amount of things regarding both Front-end & Back-end. I will write some articles about it later

## Coding & best practices

This project is by no means represents a good example of how to build an app. Honestly, I didn't even think I would finish it but here we are. You will find 0 informative commits, Not proper usage of TypeScript & maybe other stuff I didn't notice.

Why? Well because this code is how I learn things, I read about them then start applying & see the results. Also, I was building it just to learn Next.js & some other stuff didn't know I would enjoy it so much that eventually, it will become my site.

If you wanna contribute, fix stuff, or whatever feel free to do so. The code is open source.

## Lessons learned

- Stop wasting your time for a month in a [lab](https://rsms.me/inter/lab/) just to get the perfect thing, nothing is perfect
- Iterate & enhance as you go, don't redo everything from scratch after the first failure
- No knowledge is irrelevant or a waste of time. As I said before this helped me a lot with other specialties ( for example Caching & invalidating it, Static content, & delivery through CDN )
- Wanna do something? do it! Stop thinking about the perfect execution. When was the last time you did something totally new & it was perfect on the first try?

## Acknowledgment

This site would never be live without these resources, Mostly Copy Pasta of their designs & code snippets, or simply by looking at the way things are handled.

## Infrastructure

I won't be discussing the infrastructure in this post due to a large amount of information, I will split that into a series of articles, However, the tools mentioned above are running on 6$ VPS. If you wanna learn more about please feel free to contact me.

## What's next

I will keep iterating & enhancing the app, code-wise, UI/UX, tooling & content.

If you have some suggestions then contact me!
