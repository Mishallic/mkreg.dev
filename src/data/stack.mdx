## Stuff for developing

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as main editor, and [Vim](https://github.com/omaralsoudanii/vimrc) when i can (the config is a fork with minor tweaks).
  
  some times I use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) when i wanna work on.... you know. 
  Then I abandon it when it decides to reserve 20GB of RAM while editing a small NodeJS program.

- Whatever Terminal comes with the distro I have, currently GNOME Terminal with customized colors using [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy). Although when I had KDE, I   loved Konsole
    
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for coding stuff, [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for reading
- [Brave Browse](https://brave.com/)
- Recently I started using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as a reminder & calendar for what's next!
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) (The old design, I'll just stop visitng if they remove it), and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Browsing those sites is a sign that I have some chore work to do, or stuck on something stupid.

## Workstation

- An ancient desktop PC that you don't even wanna know about (Yes i do whine when Electron eats my RAM for lunch)

I'll update this page whenever I learn something, or have a roadmap for learning maybe? No clue.
