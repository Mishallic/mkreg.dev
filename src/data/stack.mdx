## Stuff for developing

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as main editor, and [Vim](https://github.com/omaralsoudanii/vimrc/) when i can (my config is a fork from [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/) with minor tweaks like deleting plugins i don't need). Some times I use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) when I wanna work on, Ummmm actually I'll let that up to you to guess WHAT language is locked to using an IDE.Then I abandon it when it decides to reserve 20GB of RAM while editing a small NodeJS program.
- Whatever Terminal comes with the distro I have, currently GNOME Terminal with customized colors using [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy). Although when I had KDE. I loved Konsole
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/)
- [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/)
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for coding stuff, [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for reading
- [Brave Browse](https://brave.com/)
- Recently I started using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as a reminder & calendar for what's next!
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) (The old design, I'll just stop visitng if they remove it), and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Browsing those sites is a sign that I have some chore work to do, or stuck on something stupid.

## Workstation

- An ancient desktop PC that you don't even wanna know about (Yes i do whine when Electron eats my RAM for lunch)
