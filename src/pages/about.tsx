                Iâ€™m Omar Alsoudani, a Software developer, based in Amman,
                Jordan. I've been building stuff on the web for about 7 years or
                so (I stopped counting after a while). Working with companies
                across various countries & industries. My focus is on creating
                correct, scalable & performant applications. Powered by cloud
                agnostic infrastructure using the proper tools with DevOps
                mindset.

                To be honest, I have stopped counting what programming languages
                I know and what frameworks I can work with. I am of the mindset
                that coding, programming languages won't matter after a certain
                point.

              <p className="text-xl">
                What I try to do best is to recognize the challenges that arise
                during the life cycle of developing a software, whether it's
                about business, technical debt and you probably the rest.

                Then, based on my knowledge and experience, and other factors
                unique to the problem in hand. I approach the problem in an
                abstract way to get a solution.

              <p className="text-xl">
                In summary the technology you are gonna use is a tool to solve
                the problem. Understanding the problem and identifying the core
                cause is more valuable for me, (Unless you are a PHP developer
                ofcourse ðŸ¤¦).

                Well, let's just accept the fact that my frontend skills is
                kinda worse than NVIDIA drivers support for linux. On a serious
                note, I simply don't have the talent for UI/UX, neither the
                experience on how to create eye pleasing applications. However I
                have a lot of knowledge in the Frontend engineering parts.
