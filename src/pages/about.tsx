                Iâ€™m Omar Alsoudani, a Software developer, based in Amman,
                Jordan. I've been building stuff on the web for about 7 years or
                so (I stopped counting after a while). Working with companies
                across various countries and industries. Following the DevOps
                methodology, my focus would be on building correct, scalable and
                performant applications, Powered by cloud agnostic
                infrastructure.

                What technologies and programming languages you consider your
                self good at?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-p-2">
                To be honest, I have stopped counting what programming languages
                I know and what frameworks I can work with. I am of the mindset
                that coding, programming languages won't matter after a certain
                point.
              </p>
              <p className="text-p-2">
                What I try to do best is to recognize the challenges that arise
                during the life cycle of developing a software, whether it's
                about business, technical debt and you probably know the rest.

              <p className="text-p-2">
                Then, based on my knowledge and experience, and other factors
                unique to the problem in hand. I approach the problem in an
                abstract way to get a solution.
              </p>
              <p className="text-p-2">
                In summary the technology you are gonna use is a tool to solve
                the problem. Understanding the problem and identifying the core
                cause is more valuable for me. Unless you are a PHP developer ðŸ¤¦
                (nah, just kidding).

                Well, let's just accept the fact that my Frontend skills is
                kinda worse than NVIDIA drivers support for linux. On a serious
                note, I simply don't have the talent for UI/UX, neither the
                experience on how to create eye pleasing applications. However I
                have a lot of knowledge in the Frontend engineering parts.
