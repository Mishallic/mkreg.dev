              Iâ€™m Omar Alsoudani, a Software developer, based in Amman, Jordan.
              I've been building stuff on the web for about 7 years or so (I
              stopped counting after a while). Working with companies across
              various countries and industries. Following the DevOps
              methodology. My focus would be on building correct, scalable and
              performant applications, Powered by cloud agnostic infrastructure.

              <p className="text-lg">
                To be honest, I have stopped counting what programming languages
                I know and what frameworks I can work with. I am of the mindset
                that coding, programming languages won't matter after a certain
                point.

              <p className="text-lg">
                What I try to do best is to recognize the challenges that arise
                during the life cycle of developing a software, whether it's
                about business, technical debt and you probably know the rest.

                Then, based on my knowledge and experience, and other factors
                unique to the problem in hand. I approach the problem in an
                abstract way to get a solution.

              <p className="text-lg">
                In summary the technology you are gonna use is a tool to solve
                the problem. Understanding the problem and identifying the core
                cause is more valuable for me. Unless you are a PHP developer ðŸ¤¦

                Well, let's just accept the fact that my Frontend skills is
                kinda worse than NVIDIA drivers support for linux. On a serious
                note, I simply don't have the talent for UI/UX, neither the
                experience on how to create eye pleasing applications. However I
                have a lot of knowledge in the Frontend engineering parts.
