          Well, Congrats on finding this page! Let me introduce you to my
          favorite human being in the universe. The legend himself Mr.Mark
          Knopfler.

          If you have ever wondered why the hell I have this weird domain name
          rather than something closer to my name (for SEO blah...), Then I can
          tell you that it's based on this acronym:
        </p>
        <p className="mx-auto text-center">
          <a
            className="text-link"
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZWDmY6_E2A"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"

            Mark Knopfler Red Electric Guitar
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone has his own "Red Electric Guitar". Seeing this beautiful
          genuine soul getting his guitar is always a pleasure that puts a smile
          on my face.

          So there you go, now you have the answer to the ultimate question of
          life.
